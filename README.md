# Detecting Happy ðŸ˜„ and ðŸ¥º Sad Faces from Images

This repository contains code and resources for detecting happy and sad facial expressions in images using a Jupyter notebook. The project demonstrates basic computer vision techniques for identifying different emotions in facial images.

## Repository Structure

- **`detecting-happy-sad-faces-from-images.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step implementation of a facial expression detection model, focusing on identifying happy and sad faces.
- **Images**: Sample images used for testing the model, such as `154006829.jpg` and `8iAb9k4aT.jpg`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - TensorFlow/Keras (optional, if using a neural network-based approach)

You can install the necessary libraries by running:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   gh repo clone patelandpatel/detecting-happy-sad-faces-from-images
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```sh
   cd detecting-happy-sad-faces-from-images
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook detecting-happy-sad-faces-from-images.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to run the detection on the provided sample images or your own images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to detect whether the faces in given images are displaying a happy or sad expression. This project utilizes image processing techniques and machine learning methods to accomplish this goal.

### Key Steps:

- **Image Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess images for feature extraction.
- **Feature Extraction**: Use methods such as Haar cascades (OpenCV) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for extracting facial features.
- **Emotion Classification**: Implement a simple model to classify facial expressions as happy or sad.

## Example Results

Below are some examples of the happy/sad detection results:

- `154006829.jpg`: Detected as **Happy**
- `8iAb9k4aT.jpg`: Detected as **Sad**

The notebook includes code for displaying the processed images along with the predictions.
